  // split reverse join

  // pretty much standard for reversing a string, 

  // two other ways it can be done as well, one being a for loop, and the other i think is recursive?

// The split() method splits a String object into an array of string by separating the string into sub strings.
// The reverse() method reverses an array in place. The first array element becomes the last and the last becomes the first.
// The join() method joins all elements of an array into a string.
