Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array
Another useful array function is Array.prototype.filter(), or simply filter().

filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns a truthy value - that is, a value which returns true if passed to the Boolean() constructor. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.

See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

const users = [
  { name: 'John', age: 34 },
  { name: 'Amy', age: 20 },
  { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 }
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter(user => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30); 
The console would display the value [ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ].

The variable watchList holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of filter and map on watchList to assign a new array of objects with only title and rating keys. The new array should only include objects where imdbRating is greater than or equal to 8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and you may need to convert them into numbers to perform mathematical operations on them.


---------------


gonna have to redo alot of this now because most of this makes no fkn sense with how they are describing it

Hints
Hint 1
This challenge is solved in 2 steps.

Array.prototype.filter() is used to filter the array so itâ€™s left with elements that have imdbRating > 8.0.

Array.prototype.map() can be used to shape the output to the desired format.

Solutions

Solution 1
```js
const filteredList = watchList
  .filter(movie => {
    // return true it will keep the item
    // return false it will reject the item
    return parseFloat(movie.imdbRating) >= 8.0;
  })
  .map(movie => {
    return {
      title: movie.Title,
      rating: movie.imdbRating
    };
  });
```
Code Explanation

First we filter through and only return the objects that meet the criteria. In this case the criteria is having an imdbRating of 8.0 or higher.
Then we map the objects to the desired format.

Solution 2
```js
const filteredList = watchList
  .filter(movie => movie.imdbRating >= 8.0)
  .map(movie => ({ title: movie["Title"], rating: movie["imdbRating"] }));
// Only change code above this line
console.log(filteredList);
```
Solution 3
```js
// Only change code below this line
const filteredList = watchList
  .filter(({ imdbRating }) => imdbRating >= 8.0)
  .map(({ Title: title, imdbRating: rating }) => ({ title, rating }));
// Only change code above this line

console.log(filteredList);
```
